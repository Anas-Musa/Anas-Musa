Hello! I am Anas Musa. A Senior Software Engineer with more than 6 years of professional experience in Software Design and Development, 
Project Management, Data Analysis and Software Architecture. I am a self-motivated software developer with experience in both front-end and 
back-end development. My knowledge of designing real-world problem-solving products has grown as a result of my experience with personal projects, 
freelancing projects, and hackathons. I'm very enthusiastic about continuing to learn and improve my skills.
